Base Install is a starter theme for WordPress development using Underscores as a starting point. It features a [theme wrapper](http://scribu.net/wordpress/theme-wrappers.html) inspired by Scribu, a responsive grid based on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) by Dave Gamache, and a workflow built on the fantastic [WPGulp](https://labs.ahmadawais.com/WPGulp/) by Ahmad Awais. 

Currently under active development, but the demo can be viewed here: [Base Install Demo](http://losaidos.com/dev/baseinstall).
