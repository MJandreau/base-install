Base Install is a starter theme for WordPress development using Underscores as a starting point. It features a [theme wrapper](http://scribu.net/wordpress/theme-wrappers.html) inspired by Scribu, a responsive grid based on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) by Dave Gamache, and a workflow built on the fantastic [WPGulp](https://labs.ahmadawais.com/WPGulp/) by Ahmad Awais. 

This theme is currently under active development and will see some changes, but the demo as it is now can be viewed here: [Base Install Demo](http://losaidos.com/dev/baseinstall).



Quick Start Guide

This quick-start guide assumes you already have a local development environment with WordPress already installed and running. More detailed documentation is in the works, but this theme is geared toward those who already have some development experience.

First, either download the files from this repo on GitHub or run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
$ cd your-wp-directory/wp-content/themes
$ git clone https://github.com/mikejandreau/Base-Install
```

```javascript
var projectURL              = 'dev8'; // Project URL. Could be something like localhost:8888.
```
